# win-firewall-test-cs
Test program written to get how Advanced Windows Firewall API works.
This code list all WFS rules, add one rule and then delete it. Work only with Windows Firewall with Advanced Security. 
WFS was first released with Windows Vista/Windows Server 2008 (R1) so this is minimum supported OS. Also code must be run with Administrator rights - already forced with manifest file :).
